# Project Happy Thoughts API

This weeks project was about creating an API in MongoDB with 2 endpoints using both GET and POST method and connect it to our frontend project Happy Thoughts that we did early on in this bootcamp.

## The problem

This project was overall pretty simmilar to last weeks express API with the dirfferent endpoints, So the setup was pretty easy. The complicated thing was to get it to work with the frontend. and do be consistent with the naming ogf things.
